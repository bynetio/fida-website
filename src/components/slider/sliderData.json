Thus, for investors who have many Fida cards representing multiple different policies (a portfolio), the premium generated across all policies is used to pay any potential claims for any policy before the underlying collateral is used. This encourages investors create a diverse portfolio so the 'premiums of the many pay for the claims of a few'."
